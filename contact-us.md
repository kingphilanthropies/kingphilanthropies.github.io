King Philanthropies employs a personalized and targeted approach to philanthropy. We dedicate ourselves wholly to the initiatives that fit within the goals of our founders and our larger mission to alleviate extreme poverty in Africa and parts of Asia. For this reason, we cannot accept unsolicited requests for funds. Other inquiries can be sent to info@kingphilanthropies.org.
