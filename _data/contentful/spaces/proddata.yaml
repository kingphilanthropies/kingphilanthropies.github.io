  title: Solving extreme poverty
  content: "# 1+1=3\n\nOver the past half century, we have been privileged to welcome
    into our California home more than 50 students from across the globe, most of
    whom came from afar to study at Stanford University.  We hosted these students
    because we believe in the commandment to “love your neighbor as yourself” and
    do our best to follow it.  Yet each of these students gave us so much more than
    we gave them, broadening our world in ways we could never have dreamed.  Through
    them, we truly came to understand that the word “neighbor” is not limited to those
    who live side-by-side on the same street, or even to residents of the same town,
    or citizens of a single country.   On the contrary, as the world shrinks with
    astonishing speed, our neighbors are now everywhere on this earth. \n\nSadly,
    many of our neighbors are struggling. \nNearly 10 percent of the world’s population
    – 702 million people - live on $1.90 a day, or less, a bleak statistic that is
    unconscionable to us.  Simply to survive at such an income level is a daily challenge
    – to thrive, all but impossible.  Most of the people who live in extreme poverty
    are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.  In 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa accounted
    for nearly half of the global poor, with one in three of its people living in
    extreme poverty and oftentimes lacking access even to electricity and clean water,
    not to mention education and opportunity.  South Asia has seen the percentage
    of extreme poor in its population decline to about 10 percent in recent years,
    but that figure encompasses huge numbers of people.  \n\n![King-Philanthropy LetterFromFounders](//images.contentful.com/0cp1epmalnde/2uubVOQBKouuISwISUiyeW/bc4f2fc2daebf7831525571f492e44d7/King-Philanthropy_LetterFromFounders.jpg)\n\nWe
    seek to address the tragedy of global poverty by fostering entrepreneurship that
    will lead to job creation; supporting the development of future leaders and investing
    in the development of our youth; and enhancing the food security, nutrition, and
    rural livelihoods of the world’s poorest.  In choosing where and how to direct
    our philanthropy, there is one “equation” we always keep in mind: 1 + 1 = 3.  This
    guides us to adopt a systematic approach when seizing opportunities; we support
    organizations that will take full advantage of all available collaboration opportunities,
    create a positive cascading effect, and generate outsized impact. \n\n__Solving
    Poverty by Job Creation:__\nThe Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing
    Economies, or Stanford Seed, was founded in partnership with the Stanford Graduate
    School of Business to address extreme poverty through job creation by scaling
    businesses.  It aims to build entrepreneurship from the bottom up in developing
    economies, fostering a generation of successful entrepreneurs who will reach out
    and guide the next generation.  Seed is an action-oriented program in which research
    informs practice, creating a positive feedback loop between Stanford faculty and
    entrepreneurs from developing nations who are actively working to scale their
    enterprises.  Through its GDP Research Initiative, Seed supports research that
    relates to poverty alleviation spanning disciplines across all of Stanford University,
    including public health, education, law, political science, engineering, computer
    science, and the environment, among others.\n\n__Providing Scholarships for Future
    Leaders of the Developing World:__\nThe King Scholars program is based on a simple
    premise – that those with direct experience of poverty are best positioned to
    alleviate it.  It brings outstanding students from developing nations to leading
    American colleges and universities (initially Dartmouth and the University of
    Wisconsin) for a world-class education, extraordinary internship opportunities,
    and the chance to participate in a leadership training program designed to support
    careers related to poverty alleviation.  The Knight Hennessy Scholars program
    for graduate students at Stanford seeks to identify rising leaders from around
    the world, expose them to real-life challenges, and better equip them to lead
    ambitious change.  \n\n__Promoting Positive Youth Development for Disadvantaged
    Youth:__\nThe Thrive Foundation for Youth guides disadvantaged youth to reach
    their full potential by strengthening the presence and impact of caring adults
    in their lives. It relies on partnership with successful programs and evidence-based
    research pragmatically applied. In recent years, the Thrive Foundation for Youth
    has invested its resources in changing the trajectory of the lives of disadvantaged
    youth across the United States. Going forward, the Thrive Foundation for Youth
    seeks opportunities to leverage best practices in youth development globally,
    with a focus on youth growing up in poverty.\n\n__Alleviating Poverty by Combatting
    Hunger and Malnutrition:__\nOur new Food, Nutrition, and Rural Livelihoods Initiative
    seeks to alleviate extreme poverty by focusing on the more than 500 million people
    who suffer from hunger and undernourishment in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
    \ Malnutrition has many terrible effects, including stunted physical growth and
    impaired brain development. But one of its greatest cruelties is the theft of
    individual and collective potential – those who hover on the brink of starvation
    can never break the grasp of poverty and illness, which then persist for generations.
    \ Fortunately, there is ample evidence that reducing or eliminating malnutrition
    leads to improvement in individual and societal health, education, earnings, and
    even GDP. We have chosen to start this new initiative in Myanmar with a pilot
    program to support outstanding organizations working in food, nutrition, and rural
    livelihoods. We picked Myanmar because of need – the country has one of the highest
    malnutrition rates in the Asia-Pacific region – and because the government has
    committed itself to significant change. Subsequently, we will extend our efforts
    to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.\n\nOur new initiative to combat extreme poverty
    is built on the same three cornerstones as all our philanthropic endeavors: focus,
    collaboration, and results.   In other words, adopt a laser-like focus on unmet
    needs and work with others whenever possible – by walking together, we will all
    walk farther.  The truth of this African proverb has guided us throughout our
    lives, and it is in this spirit that we invite you to join us in the fight against
    global poverty.  Together, we can achieve concrete results and an outsized impact;
    1 + 1 = 3.  \n\n \n"

  initiativeSubtitle: ' A new generation of global leaders'
  theOpportunity: "In an era of increasingly complex global challenges, research universities
    are called to find new solutions to problems old and new and to educate courageous
    leaders who will forge collaborations and create change at scale. \"While we have
    seen great achievements in this century, future progress will depend upon our
    ability to tackle issues such as global poverty. By identifying rising leaders
    from around the world and exposing them to real-life challenges, the Knight-Hennessy
    Scholars program will equip scholars to lead ambitious change,\" says Bob King.
    \n \nAnnounced in February 2016, the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program is an unparalleled
    graduate-level scholarship program that will prepare a new generation of distinguished
    global leaders with the multi-disciplinary skills needed to address the increasingly
    complex challenges facing the world in the 21st century and beyond.  Stanford
    is uniquely positioned to be the home of the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program
    because innovation, creative problem-solving, and entrepreneurial thinking are
    among its core characteristics. Stanford is also a leader in interdisciplinary
    studies, with seven world-class schools and an atmosphere that fosters collaboration
    and innovation. Stanford's graduate academic programs are top-ranked internationally,
    and Stanford's distinctive culture places a priority on working across disciplinary
    lines to advance knowledge and create solutions.\n"

    In 2012, they seized a unique opportunity to lessen poverty by fueling job creation

    \n\nThe Kings established the Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing
    Economies, better known as Seed, to leverage the GSB’s innovative mindset and

    new entrepreneurial ventures and scaling existing enterprises.  Because global
    poverty is multi-dimensional in nature, the Kings wanted Seed to avail itself
    of research expertise across the university. To this end, Seed’s GDP Research
    Initiative supports research that relates to poverty alleviation spanning disciplines
    across Stanford, including public health, education, law, political science, engineering,
    computer science, and the environment, among others.\n"

    The King Scholars program is built on a simple premise: poverty alleviation can be best achieved by those who have direct experience of it. So in 2012, when Bob and Dottie King set out to train and equip a new generation of leaders to alleviate poverty across the globe, they looked to those who had themselves grown up in poverty. The Kings recognized that emerging leaders could be identified as early as high school and provided with a world-class college education and leadership training that would prepare them to employ game-changing solutions in poverty alleviation. King Scholars have grown up in poverty and know whereof they speak.  They demonstrate a passionate commitment to leading future poverty alleviation efforts in their home countries and are uniquely positioned to effect significant change.

  theOpportunity: "Over 15 years ago, Bob and Dottie King and their adult children
    agreed on their family’s philanthropic commitment to help youth to realize their
    full potential, or to “thrive.”  They focused their attention in the field of
    positive youth development, which intentionally highlights the assets, interests
    and abilities of youth and adolescents, rather than emphasizing the negative outcomes
    that youth need to avoid.  By investing in quality research as well as on-the-ground
    experience, the Thrive Foundation for Youth has meaningfully contributed to the
    advancement of the field of Positive Youth Development.  In this regard, the Kings
    have used their resources to create opportunities to bridge research and practice
    in youth development.\n \nMore than 20% of America’s 42 million youth live below
    the federal poverty line, and nearly half of American youth live below 2x the
    federal poverty line.  Evidence suggests that being poor makes it more difficult
    to thrive, impacting the academic achievement, employment opportunities, exposure
    to violence, and mental and physical health of youth.  In recent years, the Thrive
    Foundation has invested its resources in changing the trajectory of the lives
    of disadvantaged youth across the United States. Going forward, as a division
    of King Philanthropies, the Thrive Foundation seeks opportunities to leverage
    best practices in youth development globally."

  initiativeSubtitle: Combatting malnutrition to improve earnings, education and health
  theOpportunity: "King Philanthropies is focused on alleviating extreme poverty,
    so working in areas related to Food, Nutrition, and Rural Livelihoods brings tremendous
    opportunity for impact. More than three-quarters of the world’s extreme poor live
    and work in rural areas, do not have enough to eat, and suffer from under-nutrition.\n\nIndeed,
    in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia alone, more than 500 million people suffer
    from undernourishment; poor nutrition causes 45 percent of deaths in children
    under five years old.  Malnutrition stunts physical and mental growth and robs
    people of the ability to reach their full potential, thus trapping them in a cycle
    of poverty and illness that can persist for generations. \n\nEvidence shows that
    malnutrition is not just an effect of poverty, but also a cause. Reducing and
    eliminating malnutrition therefore brings multi-faceted benefits, including improvement
    in school attainment, health, wages and ultimately higher gross national product.
    To fully move out of extreme poverty, those in rural areas must be well-nourished
    and also have opportunities to improve their livelihoods, typically by moving
    beyond subsistence farming into situations where they can sell surplus and processed
    crops. The importance of rural livelihoods is underscored by research that shows
    that growth in the agriculture sector is about two to four times more effective
    in raising incomes among the poorest compared to other sectors.\n \nKing Philanthropies
    selected Myanmar as the first location of our pilot in Food, Nutrition and Rural
    Livelihoods because of its significant unmet needs in these areas and because
    the country is at a critical inflection point.  Two-thirds of Myanmar’s 54 million
    people live in rural areas, and the country has some of the highest rates of malnutrition
    in the Asia Pacific region. For example, more than one in three children in Myanmar
    are stunted (i.e., short for age, an indicator of chronic undernutrition), with
    children in the country’s poorest households twice as likely to be stunted.[1]
    Despite the country’s increased economic development in recent years, significant
    poverty and poor nutrition remain prevalent. We believe that now is the time to
    intervene in Myanmar to help address these unmet needs.  The new national leadership
    has coalesced political will and is committed to moving the country’s development
    forward.\n\n[1] <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/Nutrition%20-%20July%202014.pdf\"
